                        The bar and grouped bar charts are designed for senior managers to make decision on global energy sources production,
                        however, the data in both graphs are presented in a way that everyone can get global and country specific energy source capacity production
                        in megawatt. The data is grouped by energy source (fuel), country, capacity in meggawatt and depending on user
                        filters data aggregation and tranformation is applied. The main reason why those area of information such country, fuel and capacity
                        were selected is the availability of information for more than 95% of the selected columns in the dataset. Some of the columns in the dataset don't have data
                        or are blank which makes comparison difficult or improper. However, reasons behind chosen bar graphs are visbility, readability and attraction.
                        The data in both graphs are visible, easily readable and attract users by providing information, so users can get visible information in a single look.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Users get four main source of information from the visualization. First, overall capacity in meggawatt by energy source (fuel),
                        second, compare countries production on specific fuel, third, individual countries overall capacity by energy source and finally, compare countries
                        production capacity and their energy sources. Overall, the audiance understand how much power is generated by which source, what countries at what level.
                        <br />
                        The visualization allows users to produce above information by applying filters from both saved and custom filters section. However, custom
                        filters overrides saved filters. This is due to two reasons; (1) readability and (2) some countries do not produces specific energy source which results in empty graph.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        You can apply filters either by pre-defined filter or custom filters. By default the graph represents global energy source
                        production in meggawatt. This is also shown in title of the visualization. By applying pre-defined filters,
                        users get information about which specific countries produces that specific fuel. On the other hand, you can apply custom filter in two stages
                        and each stage will give you result accordingly. You can see overall energy sources and their capacity for specific country through selecting
                        country name from custom filter. Additionally, you can can also compare more than one country production capacity by ticking the
                        compare option and adding countries to the list. You can also remove countries from camparasion list. On the other hand, users can tick the options
                        to activate / deactivate legend, figures or numbers, and tooltip. Furthermore, users can sort by country, capacity and energy source. Finally,
                        the title of the page represents your filters.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        To sum up, the audiance either executives or public would realize the production and energy source capacity globally, country specific and compare countries production capacity
                        with the aim to understand highest and lowest energy source production. Furthermore, it is easy to understand the major sources of energy production
                        and make decisions on topics such as climate change and investing on renewables.
